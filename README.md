# Sequence Type Speed Evaluator
A simple web-app to collect data on average typing speed of characters and bigrams.

It was origionally created with the intent of being able to collect empherical data to aid in picking the best link hints in [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium).

Also it will hopefully collect some interesting data on which characters people can type the fastest and various trends that may be associated with that. Currently there does not seem to be any easily accessable data in literature.
