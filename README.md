# Sequence Type Speed Evaluator
A tool to collect data on average typing speed of characters and bigrams.

Created with the intent of being able to collect empherical data to aid in picking the best link hints in [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium).

Also will hopefully collect some interesting data on characters people can type the fastest which seems to be missing from current literature.
